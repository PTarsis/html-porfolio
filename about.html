  Professor who thrives on the seamless blend of technology and education. My obsession with artificial 
  intelligence is not just a passing phase, but a profound reflection of my continuous journey as a 
  lifelong learner.</p>

  <p>Recently, I've delved back into the intricate world of coding, a testament to the age-old adage
